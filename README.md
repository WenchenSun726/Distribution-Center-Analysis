# Distribution Center Analysis

The intent of this project is to analyze available inputs (historical demand and supply, customer ship-to locations and expected lead-times, supplying plant and 3rd party supplier locations, freight costs, inventory, etc.) and determine optimum distribution center locations to serve what is predominantly a U.S. / North American market for professional tools. Key measures of success will be this businessâ€™ ability to meet customer expected lead-times of 48 hours or less (order to ship), high levels of on-time delivery and fill rate, minimum total freight cost, and optimum facility cost (lease cost, avg. wage rates).
